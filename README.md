The following is extracted from the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) for brainfuck. If you would like a better insight into the history and origin of this language, I'd recommend you to head over there.

>Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller.[1]
>
>Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer and an instruction pointer. While it is fully >Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into >microscopic steps.
>
>The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's >understanding.
